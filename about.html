  <p>Hi my name is Tom and i love mountain biking.For the first 10 years of my workimg career i was the same as most people bored in my job with no challenges no excitment so much so that in 1999 i decided to start my own company callled Dirty weekends, i felt that there were no companies that truly understood that people want weekends away where you can bring your bike and enjoy what theis country has to offer us.
      This is where Dirty weekends comes in we offer a bespoke service where you choose how much or how little you do its your weekend to have fun and relax as you take in the stunning landscape that this great country of ours.   </p>
